                  <p>Global warming, a defining challenge of our time, marks a complex and interconnected phenomenon that has evolved through various key stages. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century, when the extensive use of fossil fuels began contributing to a significant increase in atmospheric carbon emissions, the world has witnessed a continuous escalation in the Earth's average temperature. </p>
                  <p>This narrative thread can be traced through a series of landmark events and discoveries. In 1958, Charles David Keeling's meticulous CO2 measurements laid bare the relentless rise in greenhouse gases. Subsequent decades brought about heightened public awareness, typified by the first Earth Day in 1970, and culminated in international efforts such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015). Alongside critical scientific milestones like the ongoing IPCC Reports, activism, as seen in the global climate strikes starting in 2018, has helped shape the public discourse. As we stand amid record-breaking temperatures and melting ice sheets, the need to explore and understand the data behind global warming becomes more urgent and relevant than ever. In the following pages, we will delve into the quantitative aspects of this existential issue, exploring the patterns, trends, and implications that the data reveal about our changing climate and the world's response to it.</p>
